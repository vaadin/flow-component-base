# flow-component-base

This project is just a `pom` containing common configuration for individual component modules. It includes for an example the build configuration for copying static resources and source codes so they can be shown in the demo.

This allows pom-files of individual components to become very small, as they only need to specify dependencies needed by the particular component.
